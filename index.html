              <p>
                <strong>Liu Kang</strong> was Earthrealm's champion, winner of
                two straight Mortal Kombat tournaments. Under Raiden's tutelage,
                Liu Kang defeated both Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn, becoming a
                legend throughout the realms. But when Shao Kahn's Outworld
                forces invaded Earthrealm, Liu Kang split with Raiden over how
                to respond. During a disagreement between them, Liu Kang was
                accidentally killed. His soul was collected by Quan Chi, who
                used it to create an evil "revenant" version of Liu Kang. He now
                serves Quan Chi and the Netherrealm.

                <strong>Kung Lao</strong> trained with the Shaolin Monks to
                become one of Earthrealm's most skilled defenders. But his
                immaturity and impetuousness prevented him from being taken as
                seriously as his friend Liu Kang. Despite Lao's shortcomings, he
                was able to defeat both Shang Tsung and Quan Chi in Mortal
                Kombat. But his life was cut short when Shao Kahn brutally
                murdered him.

                The swordsman <strong>Takahashi Kenshi</strong> spent his early
                adulthood searching the world for worthy opponents. When the
                sorcerer Shang Tsung duped him into retrieving the enchanted
                sword Sento from the Well of Souls, the result left Kenshi
                sightless. Humbled but with a new sense of purpose, Kenshi vowed
                to rid the realms of despicable creatures like Shang. He served
                Earthrealm admirably in its conflict with Netherrealm.

                served the Lin Kuei assassin clan faithfully until the first
                Mortal Kombat tournament. There Bi-Han, codename Sub-Zero, was

                name and went to Outworld to find his brother's killer.
                Meanwhile, the leadership of the Lin Kuei embarked on the Cyber
                Initiative, converting its members to cybernetic ninjas to
                increase their efficiency and remove their human imperfections.
                Kuai Liang was captured and converted. Eventually, Raiden and
                the defenders of Earthrealm restored his soul, and he joined
                their cause.
